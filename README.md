# GrandMA3 Plugin Assign Midi Remotes to Executors

Small abstractions for my specific use case of the [GrandMA3 Midi Executors Plugin by @Lenschcode](https://github.com/lenschcode/gma3-midi-executors)

## Notes

-   All Midi remotes without a page are assigned to the active page
-   Locking the Midi Remotes will prevent the plugin from changing it's assignment
